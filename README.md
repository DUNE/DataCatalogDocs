# DataChallengeWork-loginator

- the main code are in LArWrapper.py and Loginator.py.   LArWrapper actually wraps the call to LAr and should work with several access methods while Loginator produces an file-by-file summary for monitoring. 

- `setup_hms.sh` # sets it up, needs to be edited to make it work with your /tmp/..509.. file

- `./interactive_test.sh` # runs a test against the dd

- ./LArWrapper.py should be command line compatible but hasn't been fully tested.
