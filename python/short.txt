H. Schellman, July 6, 2023This is an annotated list of sam parameters which have a limited range of values found in production files created between 2018 and 2023. These are only the fields which have a small # of values.  .  There are mappings from these to metacat which we can document in future.  And many configuration parameters should probably go into an mcruns DB rather than each file. Other variables like create_time and file_size, check_sum, are also required but should be generated by the program producing the file. Strongly suggest that  adding parameters except user…. Should require data management/manager/admin approval to create/add values as on D0/MINERvA.   There are multiple redundant parameters for the same information.  Some of the redundant parameters:  DUNE.generators, DUNE_MC.generators, MC.space_charge need to be consolidated.  Suggest checking script that either changes these to the agreed upon name or forces user to change before commit for future. * user  – REQUIRED - the FNAL username for the creator of the file* file_name – REQUIRED – the name of the file* file_type – REQUIRED - used to tell mc from real data * file_format – REQUIRED - information on the format to help read it* data_tier – REQUIRED – what level of data is this* application – REQUIRED for all but raw data* data_stream – REQUIRED  FOR DATA – based on trigger and used to determine data lifetimes.* run_type – REQUIRED – what experiment/DAQ took this data* detector.hv_value – protoDUNE hv in kV* dune-raw-data.version – raw data format version * DUNE.campaign – RECOMMENDED – helps distinguish major processing campaigns.  Often used in selection * DUNE.production_status – USEFUL. – can avoid test campaigns* DUNE_MC.detector_type – USEFUL – redundant with run_type* DUNE_MC.electron_lifetime – USEFUL * DUNE_MC.with_cosmics - USEFUL* MC.with_cosmics - USEFUL* detector.hv_status – USEFUL * DUNE.requestid – RECOMMENDED for campaigns to match request, * DUNE.generators – REQUIRED FOR MC – but why is this not DUNE_MC? 	* DUNE_MC.beam_flux_ID – USEFUL FOR MC* DUNE_MC.geometry_version – USEFUL for MC* DUNE_MC.name - ??* DUNE_MC.neutrino_flavors – USEFUL for MC* DUNE_MC.TopVolume – Not certain what this is * LBNF_MC.HornCurrent – USEFUL for MC* NearDetector_MC.OffAxisPosition – USEFUL for data/MC* beam.momentum – IS this momentum or energy? * beam.polarity – USEFUL needs definition* DUNE_MC.beam_energy IS this momentum or energy? * DUNE_MC.liquid_flow – USEFUL - SHOULD BE YES/NO* DUNE_MC.space_charge - USEFUL * Not documented for data?  – SCE on/off* MC.liquid_flow – USEFUL SHOULD BE YES/NO* MC.space_charge – USEFUL SHOULD BE YES/NO. – Is this redundant with DUNE_MC? * data_quality.online_good_run_list – USEFUL * DUNE_MC.generators – REQUIRED for MC. – redundant with DUNE.generators* art.variation – USEFUL * DUNE.fcl_name – RECOMMENDED* DUNE.fcl_path - RECOMMENDED* DUNE.fcl_version_tag – USEFUL to know the fcl version * dataset.tag. – no idea what this is* DUNE.poms_campaign_id  - USEFUL for followup
